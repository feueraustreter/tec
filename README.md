tec
---
'**tec**' is a new programming languge that is user friendly as you can just write your Code. You do not have to mess with any **main** functions if you dont want to. If you want to start with tec you do not need to have any knowlege of any programming languages what so ever.
To change to a new language you can use this a ground basis to change to Java, Swift, Phython and JavaScript. If you have any knowlege in Java, Swift, Phython or JavaScript you should now have any trouble to write codes in **tec** if you know the basics.
