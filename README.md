'**tec**' is a new programming languge that is user friendly as you can just write your Code. You do not have to mess with any **main** functions if you do not want to. If you want to start with tec you do not need to have any knowledge of any programming languages what so ever.
To change to a new language you can use this a ground basis to change to Java, Swift, Python, JavaScript. If you have any knowledge in Java, Swift, Python or JavaScript you should now have any trouble to write codes in **tec** if you know the basics.

## Getting started
Create a file with the suffix **.tec**. Open the file and now you can write your first code. Start with a 'Hello World' programm.
```
print "Hello World"
```
If you execute this Program it will output Hello World.
