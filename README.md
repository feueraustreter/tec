tec
---
'**tec**' is a new programming language that is user friendly as you can just write your Code. You do not have to mess with any **main** functions if you don't want to. If you want to start with **tec** you do not need to have any knowledge of any programming languages what so ever.
To change to a new language you can use this a ground basis to change to Java, Swift, Python and JavaScript. If you have any knowledge in Java, Swift, Python or JavaScript you should not have any trouble to write codes in **tec** if you know the basics.
